# Quadratic Equations Generating and Solving

The following scripts help you create randomly generated quadratic equations and then convert them to images so you can use it in questions.

There are a few predefined formats: 
- ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c
- ax<sup>2</sup> + bx = -c
- (x-a)(x-b) = 0
- bx + c = -ax<sup>2</sup>

## How do you Generate

- Run the [Equation Generator](https://github.com/ArchanGhosh/Quadratic-Equations-Generating-and-Solving/blob/main/Quadratic%20Equation%20generator.py) file
- Each Equation has its designated count and order and order of magnitude is balanced so you dont have to worry.
- You can change the count, and random limits according to you
- Collect the CSV file that has the Coeeficients and roots
- Next Run the [Image Generator](https://github.com/ArchanGhosh/Quadratic-Equations-Generating-and-Solving/blob/main/Quadratic%20Image%20Generator.py) file
- Store in your desired location
- Done

## Extra

We have also added a Pytesseract OCR base model to find solution.
